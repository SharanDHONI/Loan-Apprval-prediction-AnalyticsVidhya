# Loan-Apprval-prediction-AnalyticsVidhya

This notebook contains the code files of the competition hosted by #AnalyticsVidhya

The Objective is to classify wheather a customer can be approved for loan based on some parameters like his education, No. of dependants,
previous loan status etc. 

I have Imported the data, analysed the necessary data, Cleansed, Imputed the Null values, Visualised and have plotted all the necessary graphs to understand the data.

For predicting wheather a customer can be approved for the loan, I have used 8 Different Models, Used the ROC curve and F1 score as a metric ( as the data was Imballanced).
I have taken the Ensemble of those 8 models to predict the test dataset. I was able to achieve an Roc score of 0.78 for the test data. 

I will be constantly updating this repo to improve the score! :)
